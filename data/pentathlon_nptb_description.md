## Pentathon: Next Product To Buy 

The available data is based on the last e-mail sent to each Pentathlon customer. Hence, an observation or row in the data is a "customer-promotional e-mail" pair. The data contains the following basic demographic information available to Pentathlon:

* "age": Customer age(coded in 4 buckets:"<30", "30 to 44", "45 to 59", and ">=60") 
* "female": Gender identity coded as Female "yes" or "no"
* "income": Income in Euros, rounded to the nearest EUR5,000
* "education": Percentage of college graduates in the customer's neighborhood, coded from 0-100
* "children": Average number of children in the customer's neighborhood

The data also contains basic historical information about customer purchases, specifically, a department-specific frequency measure.

* "freq_endurance-freq_racquet": Number of purchases in each department in the last year, excluding any purchase in response to the last email.

The key outcome variables are:

* "buyer": Did the customer click on the e-mail and complete a purchase within two days of receiving the e-mail ("yes" or "no")?
* "total_os": Total order size (in Euros) conditional on the customer having purchased (buyer == "yes"). This measures spending across all departments, not just the department that sent the message

> Note: In addition to the six message groups, a seventh group of customers received no promotional e-mails for the duration of the test ("control").
